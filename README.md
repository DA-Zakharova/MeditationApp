üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Meditation App

Meditation App is a minimalist web project that creates a calming atmosphere with soothing background videos and ambient sounds. It helps users take a mindful 5-minute break to relax and reset.

Features:
 ‚Ä¢ Three calming themes to choose from: Nature, Rain, and Waves
 ‚Ä¢ Background video and audio start automatically on desktop when the user opens a theme page
 ‚Ä¢ A 5-minute timer begins when the user clicks the message Relax...
 ‚Ä¢ Simple and clean UI for a distraction-free experience

üì± Note: Due to browser autoplay restrictions, users on mobile devices need to tap the screen to start video and audio playback.

Technologies Used:
 ‚Ä¢ HTML
 ‚Ä¢ CSS
 ‚Ä¢ JavaScript

How It Works:
 1. On the homepage, select one of the sound categories.
 2. When the themed page loads, the background video and audio begin playing automatically (on desktop).
 3. Click the ‚ÄúRelax‚Ä¶‚Äù message to start the 5-minute countdown.
